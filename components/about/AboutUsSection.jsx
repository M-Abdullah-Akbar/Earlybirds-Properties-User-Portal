                    At Early Bird Properties, We think that real estate is more than selling or buying. It&apos;s about assisting people with beginning new chapters of their lives. When I started this business, my goal was straightforward: <strong>&quot;to give each client an experience that is founded upon trust, openness, and genuine commitment&quot;</strong>
                  </p>
